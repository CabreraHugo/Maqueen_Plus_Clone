# Libraries to programm the Maqueen and Maqueen Plus robots with MicroPython

This repo provides Pythom modules to programm the Maqueen and Maqueen Plus
robots. The API is an evolution of the APLU libraries for the Maqueen (mbrobot)

(https://tjgroup.ch/index.php?site=download).

Not all the features implemented in this library are simulated in the RobotSim
simulator included with TigerJython.
