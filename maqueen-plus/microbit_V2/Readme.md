# `mbrobot` module to program the Maqueen Plus Robot

To save some memory on the micro:bit, the modul files of the `src` directory are
first minified with `pyminifier` and stored in the `dist` folder.

To install the modules on the micro:bit, just copy the content of the `dist`
folder to the root folder of MicroPython, for example using the Thonny
environment.
