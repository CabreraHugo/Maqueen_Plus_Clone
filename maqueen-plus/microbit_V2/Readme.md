# `mbrobot` module to program the Maqueen Plus Robot

To save some memory on the micro:bit, the module files of the `src` directory
are first minified with `pyminifier` and stored in the `dist` folder.

To install the modules on the micro:bit, just copy the content of the `dist`
folder to the root folder of MicroPython, for example using the Thonny
environment.

## Prepare the micro:bit V2 for programming

It is important to use a micro:bit V2. The micro:bit V1 does not have the
necessary RAM and Flash memory to support the library.

Before you can program the robot as we did in the workshop, you have to prepare
the micro:bit V2 in the following way:

1. Use Thonny to flash MicroPython on the micro:bit V2
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
3. Copy the files from the
   [dist](https://github.com/informatiquecsud/mbrobot/tree/main/maqueen-plus/microbit_V2/dist)
   folder to the root of MicroPython on the micro:bit V2. The easiest way to do
   this is to use the Thonny IDE (https://thonny.org/).

### Flashing MicroPython on the micro:bit V2

With Thonny, flash MicroPython to the micro:bit. To do this

- Connect the micro:bit to a USB port
- In Thonny, go to the menu "Run â‡’ Select Interpreter"
- Choose the "MicroPython (BBC micro:bit)" interpreter and install it on the
  micro:bit by clicking on **Install or Update firmware**

### Copying the MicroPython modules onto the micro:bit

The files to be copied on the micro:bit are located in the `dist` folder. These
files are minified using Pyminifier (https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier) to
save flash memory on the micro:bit. There is not sufficient flash memory space
on the micro:bit to upload the Python files without minification.

- Cick on the STOP/Restart Backend in the toolbox

- Ensure the micro:bit files are shown in the left panel of Thonny by clicking
  on "Files" in the View menu.

- In the files panel, navigate to the `maqueen-plus/micro:bit/dist' in the local
  file system part

- Select all the files (click on the top file, hold the Shift key and click on
  the file at the bottom)

- Right click on any of the selected files and left click on "upload to
  micro:bit". Click

Your micro:bit is ready to be programmed with TigerJython or Thonny.

### Programming the micro:bit

In thonny, you must create a new file and save it on the Micro:bit under the
name `main.py`. When you click on exectute, the file est executed on the
micro:bit if the USB cable is connected. You can also disconnect the robot from
the computer and simply restart it. The file `main.py` will be automatically
executed by MicroPython each time the robot is started or reset.
